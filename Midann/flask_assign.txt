Implement a program in Flask that retrieves information from http://apis.is/petrol. The web application should
among other things, publish information on fuel suppliers in Iceland along with their gas stations

On the project page, you should publish:
1. List of all fuel suppliers in the Json directory at http://apis.is/petrol
• Each vendor appears only once on the front page
• Pictures (logo) of the vendor are on the cover - embossed with Json.
• Date of last updated .json files (timestampPriceCheck) with
Icelandic format.
• Lowest price of 95 octane gasoline and diesel oil at any given time and name
the relevant dealer.
2. When selecting a vendor
• A list of all the dealer stations is displayed.
3. When the dealer gas station is selected, it appears
• Location
• Price of 95 octane gasoline
• price of diesel fuel
• Possibility to check the location of gas stations in google maps
Other issues:
• Use dynamic routing.
• Have template and style page (.css) - free version.
• Error route 404 - if you enter a non-existent URL

Example of finished project: https://midverk-h19.herokuapp.com/
Doesn't have to look like this, only an example, css and html part doesn't matter as long as everything works properly. Ignore the concert part of the example. I will also push it to Heroku so no need to worry about that.

Don't worry about Icelandic language, just translate to english and do it in english, i will take care of the translation after that :)
If there's problems with the pictures just let me know and i'll provide them to you.
